##GitHub Basics

If you need help getting started, check out the resources from the Big Data Academy here: https://github.kdc.capitalone.com/BigDataAcademy/Git_Foundations
It’s probably helpful to complete the course to have a general sense of how to utilize GitHub efficiently either through the command line or GUI. 

The following links contains useful quick-reference guides for editing markdown (.md) files like this one. <br>

You can also use some limited html tagging in a markdown file.

##R Access / Intro

Instructions on downloading R and RStudio can be found here: 
https://github.kdc.capitalone.com/pages/BigDataAcademy/R_Foundations_I/gettingStaRted.html 

If you want to start playing around with R on your own or try to incorporate it into your day-to-day work, one popular / helpful package to start off with is dplyr:

##A Few Resources to Start Out

A short blog post translating the most basic “Excel thinking” to “R thinking”:

The Introduction to Statistical Learning textbook (with extensive “lab” examples in R) can be found here:
http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ 

Although it’s more dense and less application-oriented, another good resource is The Art of R Programming which introduces you to the basic terminology, data types, and functionalities of R and helps highlight how to write “smart” code:

Finally – because who doesn’t want to read about statistics on their day off? – here are a few fun, miscellaneous sites to get those creative juices flowing: <br>
https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural -- weekly email listserv highlighting random interesting datasets <br>
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/#part1 – more related to classical stats than machine learning, but this great article/interactive graphic illustrated how easy it is to do “bad” stats accidentally

###Machine Learning Course - Stanford Online / Coursera, Andrew Ng
https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
-Overview of many of the most common ML algorithms, with a good mix of theory, implementation, examples, and assignments based on realistic projects. 
Some of the algorithm implementations will be more in depth than is likely needed for an analyst audience, but it's always good to understand a bit of theory behind the tools you are using.
Course consists of video lectures, short quizzes and coding assignments (mostly in Octave, an open source Matlab-like application often used to prototype models)
-Pre-reqs: Some understanding of statistics (particularly regression and measures of error) would be helpful, as well as some comfort with basic programming or prior experience with Octave or Matlab
-Time commitment: 6+ hrs/wk for ~11 weeks (though course content is made available for 180 days from the start of the course)
-Note: Coursera has been tightening their pay model, so some of the assignments associated with this or other courses may require a paid certificate registration. With that said, COF does offer education benefits (up to $5k/annum) that may cover MOOC certificte costs.
