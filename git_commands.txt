#Basic commit commands

    #Initialize a git repository at the current working dir location 
    #this command is needed per project, not per session 
    #i.e., once a repo has been created, don't need to re-init in future sessions
    git init

    #add files from working dir to staging area (-A option is add all in working dir)
    git add -A :/ 

    #permanently store the changes in the staging area to the local repo
    git commit -m "[message]"

    #push commited files/changes to the remote repository
    git push
    
    #flow: wd >>> staging >>> local repo >>> remote repo
    #         add        commit          push
