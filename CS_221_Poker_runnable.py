# You may assume the following behavior of each function:
#
# straight(ranks): returns True if the hand is a straight.
# flush(hand):     returns True if the hand is a flush.
# kind(n, ranks):  returns the first rank that the hand has
#                  exactly n of. For A hand with 4 sevens 
#                  this function would return 7.
#                  counts = [ranks.count(r) for r in ranks]
#                  if counts.count(n) == n:
#                      return ranks[counts.index(n)]
# two_pair(ranks): if there is a two pair, this function 
#                  returns their corresponding ranks as a 
#                  tuple. For example, a hand with 2 twos
#                  and 2 fours would cause this function
#                  to return (4, 2).
#                  if [ranks.count(r) for r in ranks].count(2) == 4:
#                      return (ranks[1], ranks[3])
# card_ranks(hand) returns an ORDERED tuple of the ranks 
#                  in a hand (where the order goes from
#                  highest to lowest rank). 
#
# Since we are assuming that some functions are already
